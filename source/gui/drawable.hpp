    /*!@ingroup gui
      This is the interface that any drawable object used with the
      GLContext class must implement. Note that this class is NOT intended to be instantiated
      directly. Instead, inherit the interface directly (like for example the Line class), or derive
      from its child classes DrawableFirst and DrawableLast.
      DrawableFirst and DrawableLast are intended for dynamically polymorphic use, so that their 
      child classes can be added without recompiling the Scigma gui module.
      Classes inheriting directly from Drawable must be registered in the DrawableTypes type list
      below, before they will work with GLContext. This forces a recompile of the Scigma gui module.
      Under OpenGL 3.2, this class provides a member vertexArray_, since basically all Drawables objects
      will use a VertexArrayObject.
